# SpatialHBV
Analysis of spatial transcriptomics (GeoMx) for "Characterization of HBV and co-infection with HDV and HIV through spatial transcriptomics â€“ a case study".

1. Upload the supporting supplementary data and tables to the 'Data' folder
2. Run 'QC and exploration.Rmd' to see quality control code and generate the normalised and filtered gene expression matrix
3. Run 'DEG and GO ORA.Rmd' to determine differentially expressed genes and apply an over-representation analysis
4. Run 'WGCNA.Rmd' for the weighted gene correlation network analysis and over-representation analyses on the resulting gene modules
5. Run 'Visualisation of cell deconvolution.Rmd' to visualise cell deconvolution results produced by th SpatialDecon R package.
